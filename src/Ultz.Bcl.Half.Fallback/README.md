# Ultz.Bcl.Half.Fallback
Contains a version of the System.Half type sourced from the [.NET Runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) that can be used on any platforms that don't have this type included. It's not recommended to reference this package directly. Rather, reference Ultz.Bcl.Half which will reference this package only when appropriate.
